K-Nearest Neighbors Classification Project

Overview:
This repository contains a detailed example of using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for a classification task. The project demonstrates how to implement KNN to classify entities based on their attributes, utilizing a labeled dataset to predict the category of unlabeled instances. 


Project Files
